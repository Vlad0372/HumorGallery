I personaly run this project with XAMPP, just put all the files into a new folder inside a \xampp\htdocs folder, 
use a copy of database creation code (database_dump.sql file), run it to create an instanse of the DB, and go to the http://localhost/project1/index.php address 
(don't forget to run Apache and MySQL in XAMPP)
